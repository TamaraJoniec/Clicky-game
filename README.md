# Memory Game

## Overview

For this activity, I will create a memory game with React. This activity will require you to break up my application's UI into components, manage component state, and respond to user events. Application will be deployed to Netlify.

### Instructions

1. Check out the [screenshot](https://clicky-game.netlify.com/)

2. The application renders different images (of my choice) to the screen. Each image listens for click events.

4. The application keeps track of the user's score. The user's score is incremented when clicking an image for the first time. The user's score resets to 0 if they click the same image more than once.

5. Every time an image is clicked, the images rendered to the page should shuffle themselves in a random order.

6. Once the user's score is reset after an incorrect guess, the game restarts.
